          Choosing which safety product to have in your facility is an important decision. Each device brings
          its own unique characteristics that can sometimes be difficult to understand if you are unfamiliar
          with the products themselves. Likewise each individual business also presents its own unique
          requirements and needs which is why LifeLine has chosen to represent the top 3 AED manufacturers
          in the marketplace today; Zoll Medical Corporation, Phillips Healthcare and Medtronic/Physio-Control.
          Our experienced staff will take the time to discuss the specifics of your company and walk through
          your facility with you which will give us important information as we make our recommendation to
          you as to which AED and other safety products will best meet your needs and how many you should
          place in service.
